Spread awareness within India, not just for global headlines

Showcase how technology and analytics can be tools for justice

Encourage students, developers, and policymakers to take data seriously

💡 Future Scope
Integration with real-time data APIs

NLP-based sentiment analysis of news reports

Geo-mapping and heatmaps of high-crime zones

📈 Trend of Crimes Against Women (2001–2021)

This line graph presents the year-wise trend of major crimes committed against women in India from 2001 to 2021. The categories analyzed include:

🔵 Rape

🟠 Kidnapping & Abduction (K&A)

🟢 Dowry Deaths (DD)

🔴 Assault on Women (AoW)

🟣 Attempt to Outrage Modesty (AoM)

🟤 Domestic Violence (DV)

🔍 Key Insights:
Domestic Violence (DV) cases show a steady and alarming rise over the years, indicating an ongoing societal challenge.

A sharp spike post-2011 in Assault on Women and Kidnapping & Abduction suggests possible changes in crime trends, reporting mechanisms, or legal definitions.

2011 shows a significant drop in AoW (likely due to data recording inconsistencies or missing entries).

All categories reflect an overall increasing pattern, reinforcing the urgent need for both data-driven policy action and grassroots awareness.

Crime Category Distribution (All Years Combined)

This pie chart provides a cumulative view of the percentage share of each crime type against women across all available years in the dataset. It highlights the relative frequency of different crimes reported in India over time.

📌 Breakdown:
🟩 Domestic Violence (DV) – 39.4%

🟨 Assault on Women (AoW) – 24.0%

🟪 Kidnapping & Abduction (K&A) – 17.2%

🟥 Rape – 11.1%

🟦 Attempt to Outrage Modesty (AoM) – 5.1%

🟧 Dowry Deaths (DD) – 3.3%

🔍 Insights:
Domestic Violence is the leading category, representing nearly 40% of all reported cases, underlining an urgent need for both legal reform and social awareness at the grassroots level.

Assaults and abductions together account for over 40%, indicating persistent safety threats in both public and domestic spaces.

The relatively smaller shares of dowry deaths and modesty-related assaults don’t imply less severity — these crimes are often underreported and culturally silenced.

This visualization was created using Matplotlib in Python and helps set the stage for deeper, more interactive exploration via the Power BI dashboard (Operation SINDOOR).
